ComfyUI implementation of mrv2 nodes.

The mrv2 nodes allow interacting with the BSD open source mrv2 viewer (see: https:github.com/ggarra13/mrv2).

See NODES.md for a list nodes currently provided.

mrv2 Annotations JSON: You can create masks from a .json file that creates
     		       annotations for images.
mrv2 Save EXR: Allows you to save an EXR image from ComfyUI. Note that you
     	       should ideally support a full float pipeline.
